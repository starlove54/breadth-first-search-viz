# Breadth First Search Visualization

This project provides a visualization of the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm, allowing users to observe how BFS explores and finds the shortest path from a source to a destination on a grid.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface with "Start BFS" and "Reset" buttons to initiate the algorithm and reset the grid, respectively.
- **Color-coded Nodes:** Nodes are color-coded to distinguish between different states such as the source, destination, and visited nodes.
- **Real-time Visualization:** The visualization updates in real-time, providing a step-by-step view of the BFS algorithm's execution.
- **Customizable Grid:** The grid size and node colors are customizable, providing flexibility for different scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **p5.js:** The project utilizes the p5.js library for creating the interactive canvas and handling graphics.
- **HTML and CSS:** The structure and styling of the user interface are implemented using HTML and CSS.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Click on "Start BFS" to initiate the BFS algorithm from the source node.
3. Observe the real-time visualization as the algorithm explores the grid.
4. Click on "Reset" to clear the grid and start over.

## Code Structure

- **index.html:** Defines the structure of the HTML page, including the canvas and buttons.
- **index.css:** Provides styling for the HTML elements, creating an aesthetically pleasing interface.
- **index.js:** Implements the BFS algorithm, grid creation, and visualization using p5.js.
